        <p class="text-center">SMKN Nibaaf, located in Desa Nibaaf, is the
          only SMK available in the district. Currently,
          there are a total of 125 students enrolled in
          the school.</p>
          <p class = "text-center">
          Since Desa Nibaaf is a village sitting in a
          dominantly forested region with 99% of its
          residents working in the field of agriculture,
          the school offers three programs, which are
          the following:
          Teknik Rehabilitasi dan Reklamasi Hutan
          (Forest Rehabilitation and Reclamation),
          Teknik Konservasi Sumber Daya Hutan
          (Forest Conservation), and Agribisnis
          Tanaman Pangan dan Hortikultura (Food
          Crops Agribusiness and Horticulture).
          </p>
          <p class ="text-center">
          These programs are implemented to assist
          students in pursuing their potential career in
          the agriculture or forestation industry. 
          </p>
          <p class = "text-center">
          As of November 2019, the students have
          been supplied with 17 laptops and 10
          computers to support their learnings.
          However, they could not benefit from this
          equipment as they do not have access to
          Internet in the village.
        </p>
          <p class ="text-center">
          Today, there are only five qualified teachers
          with the knowledge and skills needed to
          teach these specific programs.
        </p>
          <p class ="text-center">
          Therefore, in this next chapter, we aim
          to improve the existing inadequate
          sanitation and education conditions
          in their school by renovating toilets and
          enhancing their education system. This
          is done to further improve Desa Nibaafâ€™s
          quality of life.</p>
